This is an interactive website in providing insights for the origins of languages. It is written in HTML, Javascript, and D3.js. The visualization has multiple dimensions, including geography, distribution, language family, etc. We have done human studies and design rounds in choosing the most suitable user interface. 

Data is collected from Ethnologue.com and Wals.info. They provide exhausted and accurate information. Multiple data sets are combined, filtered, and analyzed using common attributes such as the ISO639-3 language code.
